\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{COVID Impact Statement}

The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has harshly impacted the world in many ways for the last couple years. Although Australia has been extremely fortunate in avoiding the worst of the pandemic, there were a number of limitations imposed upon this project by the pandemic and related lockdowns. Due to being unable to access lab equipment for a significant period of time, this project was certainly made more difficult. The main impacts to the project are summarised below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Limited access to equipment for testing hardware, debugging, soldering and connecting sensors, etc. Resulting in larger amounts of time and effort being necessary to perform hardware-related tasks.
  \item An overall lack of space for storing and working on hardware.
  \item Inability to perform flight testing due to lockdowns. Unable to legally visit an open space which would be suitable for flight testing. Living in an apartment block with limited space meant that flight testing in any kind of unobstructed space was next to impossible during the lockdown period.
	\item Delays in component delivery and lack of availability. Due to the overstretched postal service,  there were significant delays (4-5 weeks) in delivery of sensors and components.
\end{itemize}
