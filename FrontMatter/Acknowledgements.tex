I would like to express my gratitude to all those who have supported me through my journey over the preceding year.

Firstly I would like to thank my supervisor Jos\'e De Dona. Despite the additional difficulty of unpredictable lockdowns, Jos\'e made every effort to be available both virtually and face-to-face (when possible) and provided invaluable guidance throughout the year. Without his insight and experience this project would not have been possible.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to all the academic staff who have taught and guided me throughout my studies.

Lastly, I would like to thank all my family and friends for their support throughout this challenging year. I would especially like to thank my fianc\'ee for her love and support throughout the year.
