\section{Project Motivation}
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) allow tasks to be undertaken in difficult to access areas or risky environments without endangering human life. In many current applications, a human operator is required for remote control of the vehicle. However, with current technological advances in automation, it is becoming viable to use UAVs which operate completely autonomously i.e. without a human operator. This has the potential to improve the safety, efficiency, reliability, and cost of many processes. However, autonomous control of an aerial vehicle is a complex problem requiring the consideration of many areas of research, including but not limited to: modelling, control law design, navigation, collision avoidance, fault tolerance and sensor fusion.\\

UAVs were originally developed and used mainly by military organisations, beginning with the Sperry Aerial Torpedo developed during World War I for the US Navy, a radio-controlled biplane designed to be used as a flying bomb \cite{Stoff2001}. This was followed by decades of development leading to vehicles used for aerial target practice, reconnaissance, and remote bombing. However, in recent decades there has been an increased interest in the use of UAVs for both commercial and scientific applications. Commercial applications include surveying, aerial photography/videography, package delivery and pesticide spraying. UAVs are increasingly being utilised in many industries from mining to agriculture. Technological advances in computing and electronics have decreased the cost of UAVs and this has resulted in a large selection of vehicles being more widely available to hobbyists, not just large companies. Scientific research has also benefited from the use of UAVs, with applications including monitoring bodies of water for algal blooms, identifying plant species, monitoring coastal erosion and tracking/counting animal populations. One recent study \cite{Raoult2018} uses UAVs to track aquatic vertebrates without using invasive tagging methods. Even more recently, the first unmanned flights on another planet were completed by NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter on Mars \cite{Johnson2021}, demonstrating that UAV technology could be a viable option for extra-terrestrial exploration in the near future. Similarly, NASA has a mission planned for launch in 2026 to send a multi-rotor aircraft, named Dragonfly, to explore Titan – the largest moon of Saturn\cite{Hautaluoma2019}.  The versatility of UAVs results in an almost limitless number of applications for their use.\\

UAV operation allows tasks to be undertaken in difficult to access areas or risky environments without endangering human life. In many current applications, a human operator is required for control of the vehicle. However, with current technological advances in automation, it is becoming viable to use UAVs which operate completely autonomously i.e. without a human operator. This has the potential to improve the safety, efficiency, reliability and cost of many processes.\\

UAVs come in many different configurations with the main classifications being fixed-wing and rotor, however there also exist some hybrid configurations. Rotorcraft have the advantage of being able to perform Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL), i.e. they do not require a runway for take off and landing. Also, rotorcraft are able to hover in a fixed position, as opposed to fixed wing vehicles which need to continually move to generate lift. On the other hand, fixed-wing vehicles are generally able to travel at much higher speeds and can fly at higher altitudes. \\

Further, within each of these classifications there exist many different configurations. The defining characteristic of rotorcraft configurations is the number of rotors present on the vehicle. There is an almost limitless number of configurations from single rotor vehicles up to octocopters (8 rotors) and beyond. The topic of this paper is centred around unmanned multi-rotor vehicles and will begin with an overview of the basic dynamics of these systems. These ideas will then be extended to the specific configuration of a six-rotor vehicle - the hexacopter.
