\section{Conclusion}
This thesis explored the main conecpts necessary for the implementation of an autonomous multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle.

\section{Future Extensions}
There are many possible extensions to this project, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\item Implement the backstepping control system on the hardware platform.
\item Account for motor/propeller failure events during flight.
\item Extend sensor fusion algorithm to handle sensor failure.
\item Implement obstacle avoidance.
\item Analyse the usefulness of additional sensors.
\item Consider the impacts of other effects e.g air resistance and gyroscopic effects.
\item Consider slew rates of actuators, propeller inertia, etc.
\item Develop a quaternion-based model to avoid singularities.
\item Account for sensor biases.


\end{itemize}
