  abstract = {The aim of this article is to design and verify various control techniques for a quadrotor using a quaternion representation of the attitude. All attitude controllers use a quaternion error to compute control signals that are calculated from an actual quaternion and a desired quaternion obtained from a position controller. Attitude and position control laws are computed using a PD, LQR and backstepping control technique. All combinations of controllers will be verified by simulation. We add noise, apply an actuator restriction and use a different sampling period for position and attitude feedback signals to get the simulation closer to real conditions. Moreover, external disturbances were implemented into the simulation; hence a disturbance observer along with a position estimator will be designed to improve the performance of the presented controllers. The performance of all combinations of controllers was evaluated using various quality indicators, such as the integral of absolute errors and total thrust, settling times and also maximum overshoots when external disturbance was applied. Some of the controllers exhibit very similar behaviour, so we chose the three best controllers for each scenario used in the simulation.},

  abstract       = {Determining the small-scale movement patterns of marine vertebrates usually requires invasive active acoustic tagging or in-water monitoring, with the inherent behavioural impacts of those techniques. In addition, these techniques rarely allow direct continuous behavioural assessments or the recording of environmental interactions, especially for highly mobile species. Here, we trial a novel method of assessing small-scale movement patterns of marine vertebrates using an unmanned aerial vehicle that could complement longer-term tracking approaches. This approach is unlikely to have behavioural impacts and provides high accuracy and high frequency location data (10 Hz), while subsequently allowing quantitative trajectory analysis. Unmanned aerial vehicle tracking is also relatively low cost compared to single-use acoustic and GPS tags. We tracked 14 sharks for up to 10 min in a shallow lagoon of Heron Island, Australia. Trajectory analysis revealed that Epaulette sharks (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) displayed sinusoidal movement patterns, while Blacktip Reef Sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) had more linear trajectories that were similar to those of a Lemon shark (Negaprion acutidens). Individual shark trajectory patterns and movement speeds were highly variable. Results indicate that Epaulette sharks may be more mobile during diurnal low tides than previously thought. The approach presented here allows the movements and behaviours of marine vertebrates to be analysed at resolutions not previously possible without complex and expensive acoustic arrays. This method would be useful to assess the habitat use and behaviours of sharks and rays in shallow water environments, where they are most likely to interact with humans.},

The X-4 Flyer, a 4kg quadrotor with a 1kg payload, is intended to be prototypical of useful commercial quadrotors. The custom-built craft uses tuned plant dynamics with an onboard embedded attitude controller to stabilise flight. Independent linear SISO controllers were designed to regulate flyer attitude. The performance of the system is demonstrated in indoor and outdoor flight.},

  abstract    = {In this work, a trajectory tracking controller structure for a systemcomposed of a load and an aerial vehicle, which are connected by a rope, is presented. The main goal is to design a controller that guarantees that the load tracks a desired trajectory asymptotically. The load is modeled as a point mass while the aerial vehicle is assumed to be fully actuated. The load and the aerial vehicle are connected via a ropelike structure of fixed length that can only withstand tensile forces along itsorientation. This system can be transformed into a form that resembles the form of systems used to describe underactuated aerial vehicles. A backstepping procedure is used to design a nonlinear control law whichis based on a controller for a double integrator. A bounded controllaw for double integrators is developed such that the position of the load converges to the desired trajectory for initial positions that are arbitrarily far away from the desired trajectory. The proposed controller structure has been verified both in simulations and with experiments using quadcopters at the Smart Mobility Lab at KTH.},

  abstract = {Visually based velocity and position estimations are often used to reduce or remove the dependency of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on global navigation satellite system signals, which may be unreliable in urban canyons and are unavailable indoors. In this paper, a sensor-fusion algorithm based on an extended Kalman filter is developed for the velocity, position, and attitude estimation of a UAV using low-cost sensors. In particular an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and an optical-flow sensor that includes a sonar module and an additional gyroscope are used. The algorithm is shown experimentally to be able to handle measurements with different sampling rates and missing data, caused by the indoor, low-light conditions. State estimations are compared to a ground-truth pose history obtained with a motion-capture system to show the influence of the optical-flow and sonar measurements on its performance. Additionally, the experimental results demonstrate that the velocity and attitude can be estimated without drift, despite the magnetic distortions typical of indoor environments.},
